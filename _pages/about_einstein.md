I began my research journey focusing on theoretical work related to quantum gases. My focus later shifted to studying epidemics on temporal networks with mathematical and computer modeling. During my postdoc, I specialized in digital epidemiology and computational social science, utilizing non-conventional data sources (Twitter, Reddit Wikipedia, News) to study human behavior, specifically on topics such as influenza, vaccines, and COVID-19. Additionally, I explored the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19 through surveys and contact matrices during the pandemic. Concurrently, I explored dynamical processes on higher order networks (hypergraph) from a theoretical perspective. Overall, my research interests is in human behaviour ranging from the microscopic scale of pairwise interactions to the macroscopic scale of group interactions.
